This is the source codes to implement a console based chat application.
It is implemented in Java. Here is two different folders named "Client" and "Server"
The source codes in the server folder opens a TCP server on the system and waits for
clients or the users to join the chat room. In the Client folder the source codes are
for implementing the client side application which initially connects to the Server
to start a chat.

*** How to use***

  1. Copy the Folders with codes in your local system.
  2. Go to "Server" folder and open command window there.(Shift + right click and open command window here)
  3. type javac followed by the path of the "Server.java" file or you can simply type javac and drag the Server.java file into console.
  Now hit enter.
  4. The java files will be compiled and the respective class files will be created.
  5. type "java Server" and hit enter.
  6. The Server will be created in the system with a specified IP address and port number.
  7. Now go to "Client" folder and open a command window there.
  8. Following the previous process run the "Client.java" file.
  9. Run the client in different systems within a local network to chat with others.
Note: The application only works within the local network(Same router).
